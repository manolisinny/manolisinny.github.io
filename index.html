        I am an Associate Editor at Physical Review B (PRB), and a Bibliostatistics Analyst at the 
        American Physical Society (APS). I am also an Adjunct Associate Research Scientist at the 
        Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, at Columbia University. 
    </p>
    <p> I studied physics at Royal Holloway, University of London (BS, 1992), the University of Illinois 
        at Urbana-Champaign (MS, 1994), and Imperial College London (PhD, 1998).

        My current interests are in research assessment, science policy and science communication, and the sociology of science. More specifically, I am interested in: 
        understanding and enhancing peer review using data analysis and statistical inference (improving the review workflow process; detecting bias or conflict of interest; creating & improving referee selection protocols and tools; producing & analyzing feedback on editorial decisions; qualitative & quantitative citation analysis; recognizing citation impact patterns; etc.)
        metrics - and their limitations - that quantify the impact of scientific research (impact statistics of journals, individuals and groups) 
        sociological effects influencing the impact of scientific work 
        networks of referees and authors 
        behavioral studies of scientists
        I am based in New York City.
